      <h3>Rammerhead:</h3>
      <p>
        Created by binary-person on Github. A fully configurable proxy that
        works on many sites. The proxy allows users to create a â€œSession." When
        they access their session, their LocalStorage and cookies will be synced
        with Rammerhead. This allows for accurately mocking cookied requests and
        conveniently saving their logins even if they switch devices. This also
        enables users to configure a custom HTTP proxy server for Rammerhead to
        connect to the session.

        </li>
        <li>
          Does not rely on alert side effects for communicating with phantomjs
        </li>

          efficient, simpler, faster
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a full API - including a parametrized evaluate function - no
          more hard coded strings
        </li>
        <li>Provides additional useful methods such as waitForSelector</li>
        <li>
          Can easily inetgrate with feature testing frameworks such as
