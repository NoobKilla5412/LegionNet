    <h2>Proxy Company Listings & Descriptions</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Rammerhead:</p>
    <p>
      Created by binary-person on Github. A fully configurable proxy that works
      on many sites. The proxy allows users to create a “Session." When they
      access their session, their LocalStorage and cookies will be synced with
      Rammerhead. This allows for accurately mocking cookied requests and
      conveniently saving their logins even if they switch devices. This also
      enables users to configure a custom HTTP proxy server for Rammerhead to
      connect to the session.
