  <h1>Proxy Company Listings & Descriptions</h1>

  <h3>Rammerhead:</h3>
  <p>
    Created by binary-person on Github. A fully configurable proxy that works on many sites. The proxy allows users to create a “Session." When they access their
    session, their LocalStorage and cookies will be synced with Rammerhead. This allows for accurately mocking cookied requests and conveniently saving their
    logins even if they switch devices. This also enables users to configure a custom HTTP proxy server for Rammerhead to connect to the session.
