    <h1>Our Partners & Helpers</h1>
    <p>
      A special thanks to my best friends: Brandon Robertson, who singlehandedly made this website possible, the true computer wizard. Kaiden Lucas, a good friend
      and an annoying one who made Junior and Senior year possible for me. Clancy Hurst, who introduced me to my now favorite genre of music and is one of the
      nicest guys I've met. Melanie Dyer, a good friend since childhood who sparked my love of Horror as a genre. Audrey Godinez, a good friend and fellow Horror
      lover. And finally, my parents, for being great at what they do and for encouraging me to follow what I love. As NF would say, "It's a person who isn't
      afraid to do what they REALLY love and take the pay cut."
