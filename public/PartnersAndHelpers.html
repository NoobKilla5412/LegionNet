    <h2>Our Partners & Helpers</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      A special thanks to my best friends: Brandon Robertson, who singlehandedly
      made this website possible, the true computer wizard. Kaiden Lucas, a good
      friend and an annoying one who made Junior and Senior year possible for
      me. Clancy Hurst, who introduced me to my now favorite genre of music and
      is one of the nicest guys I've met. Melanie Dyer, a good friend since
      childhood who sparked my love of Horror as a genre. Audrey Godinez, a good
      friend and fellow Horror lover. And finally, my parents, for being great
      at what they do and for encouraging me to follow what I love. As NF would
      say, “It's a person who isn't afraid to do what they REALLY love and take
      the pay cut.”
